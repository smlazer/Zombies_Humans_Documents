# Zombies_Humans_Documents

This is just a simple rock papers scissors game. Zombies eat humans.
Humans burn documents. Documents destroy zombies because, a information
 or whatever. Does'nt really need to make sense does it? I mean really, how
does paper beat rock? It "wraps" around the rock? Rocks generally have sharp edges.
What, is the paper going to suffocate a rock? Rocks can breathe? Pretty dumb.
Ethier way, it's just accepted, so just accept that paper also can beat zombies.
